This project contains the jupyter notebooks and slides for the Berkeley-NTNU UQSA Workshop on June 28th, 2017.

The **tutorial** folder contains:

- **01_sparseRegression**: Using RVM regression in tulip to build a surrogate of pressure/flow interface.
- **02_runOptimizeModel**: Optimize an 0D circuit model of adult physiology under mild to severe heart failure conditions.
- **03_multiResolutionChaos**: Use the multiresolution basis in tulip to perform regression of an analytic function with gradient discontinuity.

## How to run the code
